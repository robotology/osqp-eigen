Simple C++ wrapper for [osqp](http://osqp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library.

## 📚 Documentation
The documentation is available online at the accompanying [website](https://robotology.github.io/osqp-eigen).


## 📄 Dependences
The project depends only on [`osqp`](http://osqp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). Please install [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)  if you want to run the tests only for testing.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 📦 Install with conda (recommended)
You can easily the library with [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/osqp-eigen-feedstock) using the following command
```
conda install -c conda-forge osqp-eigen
```
`conda` will automatically install [`osqp`](http://osqp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

### ⚙️ Build from source (advanced)

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/robotology/osqp-eigen.git
   ```
2. Build it
   ```
   cd osqp-eigen
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<custom-folder> ../
   make
   make install
   ```
3. Add the following environmental variable
   ```
   OsqpEigen_DIR=/path/where/you/installed/
   ```

## 🖥️ How to use the library

**osqp-eigen** provides native `CMake` support which allows the library to be easily used in `CMake` projects.
**osqp-eigen** exports a CMake target called `OsqpEigen::OsqpEigen` which can be imported using the `find_package` CMake command and used by calling `target_link_libraries` as in the following example:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
project(myproject)
find_package(OsqpEigen REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example OsqpEigen::OsqpEigen)
```


If you prefer to use the [`bazel`](https://bazel.build/) build system, **osqp-eigen** is available in the Bazel Central Registry, so you can use it following the docs available at [`https://registry.bazel.build/modules/osqp-eigen`](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/osqp-eigen).

##  🐛 Bug reports and support
All types of [issues](https://github.com/robotology/osqp-eigen/issues/new) are welcome.


## 🧩 Compatibility Policy

This project tries to avoid removing functionalities in minor releases, while functionalities are only removed in major version. However, this is only done in a best-effort way, and it may be possible that backward incompatibly changes occur in minor releases (see [EffVer](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/) for more details). Furthermore, the policy is that patch releases does not modify at all the public headers (i.e. the installed `.h` and `.hpp`) files of the project. This is done to ensure that no ABI change will occur in patch releases, without having to manually track ABI changes.
